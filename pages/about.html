      	CTrack is an open-source project created by Nick Cacace, a graduate student at SUNY New Paltz. <br>
	    It was created so he didn't have to haul around those heavy deadness boards, and worry about loosing the papers with wins and losess. <br><br>

      The project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/BearAlliance/Croquet-Tracker"> GitHub </a> <br><br>

	    CTrack makes use of other open source software: <br>
	    <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/"> Bootstrap </a><br>
	    Thanks to all of those who contributed!
